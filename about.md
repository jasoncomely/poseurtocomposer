<article id="post-body" class="norm h-entry "><h2 id="title" class="p-name">About Poseur to Composer</h2><div class="e-content"><p>TL;DR: I promised to post everyday on this blog, but my new career at a homeless shelter has derailed this project. I&#39;m trying to get back into some kind of groove again, both literally and metaphorically.</p>

<hr>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to read, write or play music. Never did, although that didn&#39;t stop me from playing bass guitar for a local nu metal band many years ago. I was what a musician might call a poseur (or <i>poser</i>, if you prefer the American spelling).</p>

<p>Now I want to learn to read music and to play it. My reasons are chiefly cerebral: to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/24/want-to-train-your-brain-forget-apps-learn-a-musical-instrument" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>improve my cognitive abilities</a></u> and to more fully appreciate musical genres like jazz, classical and gospel hymns.</p>

<p><b>In the next 365 days, I promise to post something new I learned about music on this blog</b>. That means everyday except Sundays until June 19, 2020 you&#39;ll see a mnemonic, or insight, audio clip... <i>something</i> that demonstrates I am progressing along. <b>I&#39;ll be learning in an informal manner, from many sources and combining different methods and techniques.</b> This may be of interest to those who want to learn music, or acquire any new skill for that matter. We can explore the learning process together.</p>

<p>Today is <b>day one</b>.</p>

<p>To manage expectations (both mine and yours), I&#39;ll mention that I work a full-time job outside of the home and unrelated to music. I&#39;m a father and active church goer. I date and socialize. I&#39;m committed to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17569566.Jason_S_Comely" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>reading 100 books a year</u></a>. I meditate daily and cuddle my cats regularly. This all takes time! Then there is my bilateral tendinitis (golfer&#39;s elbow on both arms)...</p>

<p>My point is that due to limited time and energy, I&#39;ll have to get over my perfectionism and <b>focus on quantity over quality</b>. Some of what I post of the next 365 days may be found wanting. It may also go in weird directions.</p>
